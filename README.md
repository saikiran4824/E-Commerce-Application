JWT with Refresh/Access Tokens
Efficient Token-Based Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Token) is used to securely transmit data between the client and server. The system incorporates:

Access Tokens: Short-lived tokens used to authenticate user requests and ensure session security.

Refresh Tokens: Longer-lived tokens used to obtain new access tokens, allowing users to stay logged in without re-entering credentials.

This token system enhances security while ensuring ease of use for the platform’s users.

### User Signup & Login

Security is prioritized across all aspects of the platform to protect both user and platform data. Key security measures include:

Password Hashing (bcrypt): Ensures that user passwords are securely stored.

TLS/SSL: Guarantees secure data transmission between the client and server.

Input Validation: Defends against SQL injection and other potential attacks.

These practices protect sensitive data and enhance trust in the platform.
